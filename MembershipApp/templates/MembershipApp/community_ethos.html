                                    by the following policy:</font>
                                <font size="2">Be excellent to each other. Respect each other. We want the events and
                                    community to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity
                                    and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical

                                    that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our
                                    experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether
                                    blatant or via micro-aggression. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you
                                    are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.<br></font>

                                <font size="2">2- Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment is not tolerated,
                                    and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The
                                    person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and
                                    politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant
                                    engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event and community organizers
                                    may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the
                                    offender from the event (in the case of a fundraising event, any eviction will occur
                                    with no refund.) Consent is important and something we highly value. If you are
                                    being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed,
                                    harmed or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event or community
                                    organizers immediately.<br></font>

                                at events and in online communities is unfortunately common. Creating an official policy
                                aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not
                                acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by
                                clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages
                                people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.<br>​<br>License
